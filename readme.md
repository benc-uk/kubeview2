# KubeView 2

KubeView 2 is a Kubernetes cluster visualization tool that provides a graphical representation of your cluster's resources and their relationships. It helps you understand the structure and dependencies of your Kubernetes resources, making it easier to manage and troubleshoot your cluster. It is a complete rewrite of the original KubeView project. Which I mainly wrote on a train to Norwich in 2019.

See the [original KubeView project](https://github.com/benc-uk/kubeview) for more information.
